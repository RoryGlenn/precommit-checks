# Commitment Issues

Advisory pre-commit checks that nudge, never block. A non-blocking pre-commit flow for JavaScript and TypeScript projects using Husky, lint-staged, ESLint, and Prettier. It works on pure JS, pure TS, and mixed JS/TS codebases.

**Advisory by design:** the hook reports issues but never blocks a commit, never discards unstaged work, and never rewrites already-pushed history.

## Requirements

- **Node.js >= 22** — the scripts use modern ESM features and the built-in `node --test` runner.
- Dev dependencies in your project: `husky`, `lint-staged`, `eslint`, `prettier`, plus `boxen` and `picocolors` for the boxed output.
- An ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.js`) in your project. For TypeScript, it must be TypeScript-aware (see [TypeScript and mixed projects](#typescript-and-mixed-projects)).

## Installation

1. Install the dev dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install -D husky lint-staged eslint prettier boxen picocolors
   ```

2. Copy the `scripts/` directory (including `scripts/lib/`) into your project root.

3. Run the one-command setup:

   ```bash
   node scripts/init.mjs
   ```

   This wires up the `.husky/pre-commit` and `.husky/pre-push` hooks, adds the npm scripts and `lint-staged` config, seeds an empty `precommitChecks` block, and gitignores the caches — all idempotent, so it's safe to re-run.

4. Make sure your project has an ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.js`); for TypeScript, make it TypeScript-aware (see below).

Skip step 3 and instead register the hooks and add the scripts yourself:

```bash
npx husky init
echo "node scripts/precommit-unified.mjs" > .husky/pre-commit
echo "node scripts/prepush.mjs" > .husky/pre-push
```

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "commit:fix": "node scripts/commit-fix.mjs",
    "fix:staged": "node scripts/fix-staged.mjs",
    "test:precommit": "node scripts/precommit-unified.mjs"
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,mjs,cjs,ts,tsx,mts,cts}": ["node scripts/fix-staged-js.mjs"],
    "*.{json,css,scss,md,html,yml,yaml}": ["prettier --write --ignore-unknown"]
  }
}
```

Then gitignore `.eslintcache` and `.prettiercache`.

Your next `git commit` will run the advisory checks.

## Project structure

- `scripts/precommit-unified.mjs` — the pre-commit hook entrypoint (advisory checks).
- `scripts/init.mjs` — one-command setup for a consuming repo.
- `scripts/prepush.mjs` — the opt-in pre-push test gate.
- `scripts/fix-staged.mjs` — `npm run fix:staged`, runs lint-staged on staged files.
- `scripts/fix-staged-js.mjs` — lint-staged task: `eslint --fix` + `prettier --write`.
- `scripts/commit-fix.mjs` — `npm run commit:fix`, auto-fixes and amends the latest commit.
- `scripts/lib/` — shared helpers: `ui.mjs` (boxes), `process.mjs` (spawning/tool resolution), `files.mjs` (path/test heuristics), `checks.mjs` (output parsing), `message.mjs` (advisory builder), `config.mjs` (reads `precommitChecks`).

## Active flow

- `.husky/pre-commit` runs `node scripts/precommit-unified.mjs`.
- `scripts/precommit-unified.mjs` inspects staged files, prints one consolidated summary box, and never blocks the commit.
- When automatic fixes can still be applied safely after the commit, the hook suggests `npm run commit:fix` as the post-commit amend path.
- `npm run fix:staged` runs `scripts/fix-staged.mjs`, which delegates staged-file fixing to `lint-staged`.
- `npm run commit:fix` runs `scripts/commit-fix.mjs`, which applies automatic fixes to the latest clean commit and amends it in place (with `--no-verify`, so the advisory hook doesn't re-run and print a duplicate box).
- JavaScript files are fixed by `scripts/fix-staged-js.mjs`, which runs `eslint --fix` and then `prettier --write` on the staged JS file set.
- Other staged Prettier-supported files are fixed by `prettier --write` through `lint-staged`.

## TypeScript and mixed projects

- Staged `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, `.cts`, and `.cjs` files are treated as code files alongside `.js`/`.jsx`/`.mjs`, so they flow through ESLint and Prettier just like JavaScript.
- `.d.ts` declaration files are excluded from the "missing unit tests" check.
- The unit-test heuristic recognizes matching tests in the same directory, an adjacent `__tests__/`, or a top-level `test/`/`tests/` directory (e.g. `src/foo.ts` is satisfied by `test/foo.test.ts`).
- **Prerequisite for real TypeScript:** these scripts delegate linting to your project's own ESLint config, so your `eslint.config.js` must be set up for TypeScript (e.g. [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io/)). Prettier formats TypeScript out of the box. Without a TypeScript-aware ESLint parser, ESLint will report parse errors on real type syntax.

## Unit-test heuristics

The hook flags staged code files that have no matching test, but it skips files that don't normally need one:

- test files themselves (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`) and anything under `test/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, or `__mocks__/`
- config files (`*.config.*` and dotfile configs like `.eslintrc.cjs`)
- type declarations (`*.d.ts`, `*.d.mts`, `*.d.cts`)
- Storybook stories (`*.stories.*`)
- generated code (`*.generated.*`, or files under `generated/` / `__generated__/`)

A matching test is found when it sits next to the file, in an adjacent `__tests__/`, or in a top-level `test/` / `tests/` directory (so `src/foo.ts` is satisfied by `test/foo.test.ts`).

To exempt additional paths, add glob patterns under `precommitChecks.testExempt` in `package.json` (supports `*`, `**`, and `?`):

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "testExempt": ["src/legacy/**", "**/*.pb.ts"]
  }
}
```

## Running staged tests (opt-in)

By default the hook only checks for _missing_ tests; it does not run them. To also run the tests relevant to a commit, enable it in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "runStagedTests": true,
    "testCommand": ["node", "--test"]
  }
}
```

When enabled, the hook runs `testCommand` against the staged test files plus the tests it can find for staged source files. Failures are reported as an advisory warning (the commit still continues). `testCommand` is optional and defaults to `node --test`.

> Note: enabling `runStagedTests` executes a repo-defined command (`testCommand`) on every commit, just like `lint-staged`. Only enable it in repositories you trust. Spawned tools are capped by a timeout so a hung command can't wedge a commit.

## Blocking pushes on test failure (opt-in)

The pre-commit flow is always advisory. If you want a hard gate, enforce it at **push** time instead — commits stay cheap and non-blocking, while broken code is stopped before it is shared. This is handled by a separate `pre-push` hook (`.husky/pre-push` runs `node scripts/prepush.mjs`).

It is **off by default**. Enable it in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "blockPushOnTestFailure": true,
    "testCommand": ["node", "--test"]
  }
}
```

When enabled, `git push` runs **only the tests associated with the files being pushed** — the changed test files themselves, plus any test discovered for a changed source file (same heuristic as the missing-test check) — and **blocks the push (exit 1) if any fail**. If the pushed files have no associated tests, the push is allowed. The runner is `testCommand` (shared with the staged-test feature), which defaults to `node --test` and must accept test file paths as arguments. The output streams live and ends with a boxed `N passed, N failed` summary.

To register the hook, add it once:

```bash
echo "node scripts/prepush.mjs" > .husky/pre-push
```

> The gate is capped by a timeout. To bypass it for a single push, use `git push --no-verify`.

## Configuration reference

All options live under `precommitChecks` in `package.json`; all are optional:

| Key                      | Type     | Default              | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `testExempt`             | string[] | `[]`                 | Glob patterns (`*`, `**`, `?`) for files excluded from the missing-test check.        |
| `requireTests`           | boolean  | `true`               | Set `false` to disable the "missing unit tests" advisory entirely.                    |
| `runStagedTests`         | boolean  | `false`              | Run tests for staged files at commit time (advisory).                                 |
| `blockPushOnTestFailure` | boolean  | `false`              | Run the pushed files' tests at `git push` and block on failure.                       |
| `testCommand`            | string[] | `["node", "--test"]` | Test runner used by both staged tests and the push gate; must accept test file paths. |
| `timeoutMs`              | number   | `120000`             | Max time any spawned tool may run before it's treated as timed out.                   |

```json
{
  "precommitChecks": {
    "testExempt": ["src/legacy/**"],
    "runStagedTests": true,
    "blockPushOnTestFailure": true,
    "testCommand": ["node", "--test"]
  }
}
```

## Message states

The hook prints one box per commit:

- **success** — staged files were checked and look clean
- **warning** — advisory issues found (lint, formatting, missing/failing tests); the commit continues
- **info** — nothing to check: no staged files, only a deletion, or only non-code/non-format files were staged
- **error** — the hook could not inspect Git or run a tool

## Safety model

- Commits are advisory: the hook reports issues but exits successfully.
- `npm run fix:staged` only targets staged files.
- If a file has both staged and unstaged changes, `npm run fix:staged` refuses to run for safety.
- `npm run commit:fix` only runs when tracked staged and unstaged changes are absent, so it can safely amend the latest commit.
- If ESLint cannot fix everything automatically, available fixes are still applied and re-staged, and the command exits non-zero so the remaining issues are visible.

## Performance

The hook is tuned to stay fast even on slow machines:

- ESLint, Prettier, and (opt-in) staged tests run **concurrently**.
- Tools run directly through the project's local Node binaries, skipping `npx` resolution overhead.
- ESLint (`.eslintcache`) and Prettier (`.prettiercache`) caches speed up repeated runs. Both are written to the project root and should be gitignored.

## Continuous integration

These scripts are Git-hook tooling, so disable Husky in CI with `HUSKY=0` to avoid installing hooks during `npm ci`. This project's own workflow runs `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, and `npm test` on Node 22 and 24.

## Commands

```bash
npm run init            # one-command setup (hooks, scripts, config)
npm run test:precommit  # run the unified hook script directly
npm run fix:staged      # apply staged-only ESLint/Prettier fixes
npm run commit:fix      # apply automatic fixes to the latest clean commit and amend it
npm test                 # run automated hook behavior tests
npm run test:coverage   # run tests with a coverage report
npm run lint            # lint the full repo
npm run format:check    # check formatting across the repo
```
